# Step 2: Data Cleanup Decision

## Date: 2025-07-29

## Decision: Keep Test User for Now

### Reasoning
1. The test user (`test@example.com`) has no associated data
2. It's the only user in the system
3. Removing it would leave the database completely empty
4. The mobile app might need at least one user for testing/development

### What Was Cleaned
1. ✅ Verified no orphaned records exist
2. ✅ Prepared cleanup scripts for future use
3. ✅ Analyzed data architecture issues

### Actual Data State
- **Users**: 1 test user (kept for now)
- **Exercises**: 15 Korean exercises from seed (unused but harmless)
- **Workouts**: 0 records
- **Social**: 0 records
- **All other tables**: Empty

### Architecture Issues Found
1. **Exercise Data Duplication**
   - Backend has 15 basic Korean exercises
   - Mobile app has 600+ comprehensive exercises
   - No synchronization between them

2. **Mobile App Independence**
   - Mobile app uses its own exercise database
   - Backend exercises are never referenced

### Recommendations Moving Forward
1. Keep test user until real users are created
2. Consider removing seed exercises if mobile app is self-contained
3. Document which data source is authoritative (mobile vs backend)
4. Add data validation to prevent future dummy data

## Next Steps
- Proceed to Step 3: Schema tightening
- Address exercise data architecture in future sprint
