# Step 2: Data Analysis Report

## Date: 2025-07-29

## Summary of Findings

### Production Database Analysis

1. **Users Table**
   - Total records: 1
   - Suspicious records: 1 test user (`test@example.com`)
   - This user has no activity (no workouts or posts)

2. **Workouts Table**
   - Total records: 0
   - No dummy workout data found

3. **Exercises Table**
   - Total records: 15 (all from seed data in Korean)
   - All exercises are unused (no workout references)
   - These are basic Korean exercise names from the seed file

4. **Social Posts**
   - Total records: 0
   - No social activity data

5. **Orphaned Records**
   - No orphaned workout_exercises found
   - No orphaned exercise_sets found

### Key Issues Identified

1. **Duplicate Exercise Data Sources**
   - Backend has 15 Korean exercises from seed.ts
   - Mobile app has comprehensive exercise database (600+ exercises) with English/Korean translations
   - No synchronization between backend and mobile exercise data

2. **Test User Data**
   - One test user (`test@example.com`) exists in production
   - This user has no associated data

3. **Unused Seed Data**
   - All 15 seeded exercises have never been used
   - Seed data appears to be minimal Korean translations only

### Data Architecture Issues

1. **Exercise Data Duplication**
   - Mobile app maintains its own exercise database
   - Backend has a separate exercise table
   - No clear data source of truth

2. **Missing Relationships**
   - No clear link between mobile exercise IDs and backend exercise IDs
   - Mobile app appears to work independently

## Recommendations

### Immediate Cleanup (Safe)
1. ✅ Remove test user (`test@example.com`) and any associated data
2. ✅ Clean up any orphaned records (currently none)
3. ✅ Fix social post count mismatches (preventive measure)

### Architecture Decisions Needed
1. **Exercise Data Source**
   - Option A: Use backend as single source of truth, migrate mobile data
   - Option B: Keep mobile app self-contained, remove backend exercises
   - Option C: Sync both sources with clear primary/secondary relationship

2. **Seed Data Strategy**
   - Current seed data seems minimal and unused
   - Consider if exercises should be seeded at all

### Cleanup Script Generated
- Location: `/backend/scripts/cleanup-dummy-data.sql`
- Safe to execute after review
- Only removes the test user and fixes potential data integrity issues

## Next Steps
1. Execute cleanup script after review
2. Decide on exercise data architecture
3. Document data ownership between mobile/backend
4. Consider removing unused exercise seed data
