# Exercise Tracking Improvements Summary

## Fixed Issues:

### 1. Alert.alert Replacement
- Replaced all `Alert.alert` calls with platform-aware code
- On web platform, actions execute directly without alerts
- Added visual feedback for rest timer completion
- Set type selection cycles through types on web (no popup)

### 2. Real Exercise Data
- Removed hardcoded mock data
- Implemented dynamic exercise data loading from:
  - Mock routines (for pre-built routines)
  - User-created routines from AsyncStorage
- Exercise data includes:
  - Name, target muscles, sets, reps, weight
  - Default values from routine configuration
  - Dynamic instructions and tips

### 3. Data Persistence
- WorkoutContext already handles automatic persistence to AsyncStorage
- Exercise progress saves automatically after each change
- Workout state persists across app sessions
- Completed sets and progress maintained

### 4. Visual Improvements
- Added loading state while fetching exercise data
- Rest timer completion shows visual banner
- Conditional rendering for previous session data
- Better handling of missing/optional data

## How Exercise Tracking Works Now:

1. **Starting a Workout**
   - User selects routine and clicks "운동 시작"
   - WorkoutContext initializes with routine info
   - Navigate to WorkoutSession screen

2. **Exercise Selection**
   - Tap exercise from list
   - Navigate to ExerciseTrack with exerciseId
   - Load real exercise data from routine

3. **Tracking Sets**
   - Default sets created based on exercise config
   - Enter weight/reps for each set
   - Mark sets complete with checkbox
   - Rest timer starts automatically
   - Data saves to WorkoutContext

4. **Navigation**
   - Can navigate between exercises
   - Progress maintained across navigation
   - Can return to workout overview

5. **Completion**
   - Complete individual exercises
   - Complete entire workout
   - Data persists to AsyncStorage
   - Can resume interrupted workouts

## Remaining Considerations:
- Previous session data currently not implemented
- Exercise swap functionality needs testing
- Workout history tracking for progress over time
- Integration with backend API when available
