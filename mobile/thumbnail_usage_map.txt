=== THUMBNAIL COMPONENT DEPENDENCY MAP ===
Generated: 2025-01-17
Purpose: Safe consolidation of duplicate thumbnail components

==================================================
ACTIVE USAGE (Components being imported and used)
==================================================

1. ExerciseThumbnail (from /components/common/)
   - Used by: ExercisePickerSheet.tsx (line 21)
   
2. ExerciseThumbnail (from /components/) - DIFFERENT PATH!
   - Used by: RoutineDetailScreen.tsx (line 36) as 'GlobalExerciseThumbnail'
   - Used by: ExerciseSelectionScreen.tsx (line 19)

3. EnhancedExerciseGifDisplay (from /components/common/)
   - Used by: ExerciseTrackScreen.tsx (line 41)

4. StaticThumbnail (from /components/common/)
   - Used by: ThumbnailDemo.tsx (line 3) - TEST FILE

5. getStaticThumbnail (function from /constants/staticThumbnails)
   - Used by: WorkoutHistoryScreen.tsx (line 22)
   - Used by: WorkoutDetailScreen.tsx (line 23)
   - Used by: CreateWorkoutScreen.tsx (line 17)
   - Used by: ExerciseSelectionScreen.tsx (line 18)
   - Used by: ExerciseTrackScreen.tsx (line 36)
   - Used by: WorkoutSessionScreen.tsx (line 28)
   - Used by: ExerciseTrackScreen_simple.tsx (line 23)
   - Used by: RoutineDetailScreen.tsx (line 29)
   - Used by: thumbnailMapping.ts (line 2)

==================================================
UNUSED COMPONENTS (No imports found - SAFE TO DEPRECATE)
==================================================

- FastThumbnail.tsx - NO USAGE FOUND
- OptimizedThumbnail.tsx - NO USAGE FOUND
- InstantThumbnail.tsx - NO USAGE FOUND
- LocalThumbnail.tsx - NO USAGE FOUND
- HybridThumbnail.tsx - NO USAGE FOUND
- StaticGifThumbnail.tsx - NO USAGE FOUND
- StaticFirstFrame.tsx - NO USAGE FOUND

==================================================
CRITICAL FINDINGS
==================================================

⚠️ WARNING: Two different ExerciseThumbnail components exist:
   1. /components/common/ExerciseThumbnail.tsx
   2. /components/ExerciseThumbnail.tsx

⚠️ MOST USED: getStaticThumbnail function (9 screens)
   - This is a function, not a component
   - Used in core screens (Workout, Exercise, History)

⚠️ TEST FILES: ThumbnailDemo.tsx uses StaticThumbnail

==================================================
MIGRATION RISK ASSESSMENT
==================================================

LOW RISK (can deprecate immediately):
- FastThumbnail, OptimizedThumbnail, InstantThumbnail, 
  LocalThumbnail, HybridThumbnail, StaticGifThumbnail, 
  StaticFirstFrame

MEDIUM RISK (test file only):
- StaticThumbnail (only in demo)

HIGH RISK (core functionality):
- ExerciseThumbnail (both versions) - 3 screens
- EnhancedExerciseGifDisplay - 1 screen
- getStaticThumbnail function - 9 screens

==================================================
RECOMMENDED APPROACH
==================================================

1. FIRST: Understand why there are TWO ExerciseThumbnail components
2. CRITICAL: Most screens use getStaticThumbnail FUNCTION, not components
3. Create unified component that can replace both components AND function
4. Start migration with ThumbnailDemo.tsx (test file)
5. Then migrate the 3 ExerciseThumbnail usages
6. Finally tackle the 9 getStaticThumbnail usages
7. Keep EnhancedExerciseGifDisplay as it might be for detailed view
