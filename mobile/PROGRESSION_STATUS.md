# Progression System Implementation Status

## ✅ Completed Features

### 1. **DOMS Survey** - WORKING
- Collects daily recovery data (muscle soreness, sleep, energy, motivation)
- Saves to `user_doms_data` table in Supabase
- Shows automatically each morning
- Your test data is saving correctly (sleep: 3, energy: 5, etc.)

### 2. **RPE Logging** - WORKING
- Collects workout intensity after each session (0-10 scale)
- Saves to `user_session_data` table in Supabase
- Appears after rating workout with stars
- Successfully tested and saving data

### 3. **Data Persistence** - WORKING
- Connected to correct Supabase project (ayttqsgttuvdhvbvbnsk)
- Authentication working (dannyboy0914@gmail.com)
- Tables created and accessible
- Data saving with correct values

### 4. **UI Components** - WORKING
- RPE Modal with number selector
- DOMS Survey Modal with sliders
- Test buttons for debugging
- Console logging for troubleshooting

## 🔄 In Progress

### Weight Progression Suggestions
- Code is implemented in `RoutineDetailScreen`
- Tries to fetch suggestions when starting workout
- Currently fails because Edge Functions not deployed
- Falls back to original weights

## 📋 Tomorrow's Tasks

1. **Implement simple progression logic** in the app:
   ```javascript
   // Based on recovery data:
   if (sleepQuality >= 8 && energyLevel >= 8) {
     suggestedWeight = lastWeight * 1.05; // +5%
   } else if (sleepQuality <= 4 || energyLevel <= 4) {
     suggestedWeight = lastWeight * 0.9; // -10%
   }
   ```

2. **Add visual indicators** for suggestions:
   - Show "↑ +5kg recommended" in green
   - Show "↓ -5kg recommended" in red
   - Explain why (good/poor recovery)

3. **Create a Recovery Dashboard**:
   - Show readiness score
   - Display trends
   - Give training recommendations

## 🔑 Key Files Modified

- `/mobile/src/services/progression.service.ts` - API calls
- `/mobile/src/components/RPEModal.tsx` - Post-workout rating
- `/mobile/src/components/DOMSSurveyModal.tsx` - Recovery assessment
- `/mobile/src/screens/home/HomeScreen.tsx` - DOMS integration
- `/mobile/src/screens/home/WorkoutCompleteScreen.tsx` - RPE integration
- `/mobile/src/screens/home/RoutineDetailScreen.tsx` - Weight suggestions
- `/mobile/.env` - Updated Supabase credentials

## 🗄️ Database Tables

- `user_doms_data` - Recovery surveys
- `user_session_data` - Workout RPE logs

Both tables have RLS disabled for testing.

## 🎯 Current State

The foundation is complete and working. You're successfully tracking:
- Daily recovery metrics
- Workout intensity
- Training history

Next step is to use this data for intelligent weight suggestions!

Good work today! 💪
