# 종료 Button Debug Guide

## Expected Flow When 종료 Button is Clicked:

1. **Button Press**: handleEndWorkout() is called
2. **First Alert**: Shows "운동 종료" confirmation dialog
3. **User Confirms**: Clicks "종료" in the dialog
4. **Save Process**: 
   - saveWorkoutToHistory() is called
   - Workout data is saved to AsyncStorage
   - Returns workoutData with unique ID
5. **End Workout**: workout.endWorkout() updates context state
6. **Navigation**: 
   - If save successful: Navigate to 'WorkoutComplete' screen
   - If save failed: Show error alert and go back

## Current Debug Setup:

1. **Test Button (Blue)**: Simple alert to verify ANY button works
2. **Drag ON/OFF Button**: Toggle drag functionality 
3. **종료 Button (Red)**: Currently shows simple test alert

## Debug Steps:

1. First try the blue "테스트" button - if this works, buttons are responsive
2. Try the "Drag ON/OFF" button to disable dragging
3. Try 종료 button - should show "테스트" alert
4. Check console logs for:
   - "🔴 handleEndWorkout called!"
   - Current workout state details

## Common Issues:

1. **No Alert Shows**: Button touch is still being blocked
2. **Alert Shows but Nothing Happens**: Navigation or save issue
3. **Console Errors**: Check for missing screens or type errors

## What to Check in Console:

```
🔴 handleEndWorkout called!
📊 Current workout state: {
  isActive: true/false,
  startTime: "...",
  routineName: "test",
  exercises: 1
}
```
