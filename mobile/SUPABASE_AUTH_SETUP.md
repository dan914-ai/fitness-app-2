# Supabase Authentication Setup Guide

## Current Status ✅
Your Supabase authentication is now properly configured and working!

## What Was Fixed
1. **Email Confirmation Handling**: The app now handles Supabase's email confirmation requirement gracefully
2. **Temporary Session Support**: Users can access the app immediately after signup while waiting for email confirmation
3. **Better Error Messages**: Clear Korean language error messages for all auth scenarios

## How It Works Now

### Sign Up (회원가입)
1. User enters their email and password
2. Account is created in Supabase
3. If email confirmation is enabled in Supabase:
   - User gets a temporary session to access the app immediately
   - Confirmation email is sent (they can confirm later)
4. If email confirmation is disabled:
   - User gets full access immediately

### Sign In (로그인)  
1. User enters email and password
2. If email is confirmed: Full access granted
3. If email not confirmed: Temporary access granted with notification

### Test Account
- Click "테스트 계정으로 시작" to create a test account automatically
- Each test account gets a unique email like `test1234567890@gmail.com`

## To Disable Email Confirmation (Optional)

If you want users to have immediate full access without email confirmation:

1. Go to your Supabase Dashboard: https://app.supabase.com/project/ayttqsgttuvdhvbvbnsk
2. Navigate to: Authentication → Providers → Email
3. Toggle OFF "Confirm email"
4. Save changes

## Testing the Authentication

### Method 1: In the App
1. Run: `npm start` or `npx expo start --web`
2. Open http://localhost:8081
3. Try signing up with a real email
4. You should be able to access the app immediately

### Method 2: Direct Test Script
```bash
node test-supabase-auth.js
```
This script tests the Supabase connection directly and shows detailed error messages.

### Method 3: Browser Test
Open `test-auth.html` in a browser to test authentication without the React Native app.

## Database Tables

Make sure your database tables are created by running the migration:
1. Go to Supabase SQL Editor
2. Copy contents of `supabase/migrations/001_create_all_tables.sql`
3. Run the SQL to create all necessary tables

## Environment Variables

Your `.env` file is correctly configured with:
```
EXPO_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=https://ayttqsgttuvdhvbvbnsk.supabase.co
EXPO_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=eyJhbG...
```

## Common Issues & Solutions

### "Invalid login credentials"
- Email or password is incorrect
- User doesn't exist yet - need to sign up first

### "Email not confirmed"
- This is now handled - users get temporary access
- They can confirm email later from their inbox

### "User already registered"
- Email is already in use
- Try signing in instead of signing up

### Rate Limiting
- Too many attempts in a short time
- Wait a few minutes and try again

## Production Checklist

Before going to production:
- [ ] Set up proper email templates in Supabase
- [ ] Configure custom SMTP if needed
- [ ] Enable Row Level Security (RLS) on all tables
- [ ] Set up proper backup strategies
- [ ] Configure rate limiting appropriately
- [ ] Test email deliverability
