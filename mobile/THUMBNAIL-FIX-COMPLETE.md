# Thumbnail Fix Complete ✅

## Problem Solved
The exercise list was showing animated GIFs which caused performance issues and wasn't the desired behavior.

## Solution Implemented
1. **Removed all GIF loading from exercise list**
   - No more `Image` component loading GIF URLs
   - No more `gifService.getGifUrlWithFallback()` calls in the list

2. **Replaced with category-based static icons**
   - Each muscle group now has its own icon:
     - 가슴 (Chest): airline-seat-flat
     - 등 (Back): rowing
     - 어깨 (Shoulders): accessibility
     - 팔 (Arms): fitness-center
     - 다리 (Legs): directions-run
     - 복근 (Abs): pregnant-woman
     - 전신 (Full Body): accessibility-new
     - 엉덩이 (Glutes): directions-walk

3. **Improved performance**
   - No animated GIFs in the list view
   - Static icons load instantly
   - Reduced memory usage

## Code Changes Made
### ExercisePickerSheet.tsx:
- Added `getCategoryIcon()` function to map muscle groups to icons
- Removed GIF URL fetching and Image component
- Icons displayed with primary color theme
- Removed unused imports and styles

## Testing Results
✅ No TypeScript compilation errors
✅ GIF loading completely removed
✅ Category icons properly implemented
✅ Unused code cleaned up

## User Experience
- Exercise list now shows static category icons instead of animated GIFs
- Faster scrolling and better performance
- Icons provide visual indication of muscle group
- GIFs are still available when viewing individual exercises
