# Button Fix Testing Guide

## Changes Made

All TouchableOpacity components in WorkoutSessionScreen have been replaced with Pressable components for better touch handling on all devices.

### Key Improvements:

1. **Pressable Components**: More reliable touch handling than TouchableOpacity
2. **hitSlop**: Added to increase touch target areas
3. **zIndex**: Ensures buttons are on the top layer
4. **pointerEvents**: Header uses "box-none" to prevent touch blocking
5. **Visual Feedback**: Press states with opacity/scale changes

## Test Steps

1. **Test 종료 (End) Button**:
   - Press the red "종료" button in the header
   - Should show confirmation dialog
   - Confirm to end workout and save

2. **Test Exercise Cards**:
   - Tap any exercise card to open exercise tracking
   - Long press and drag to reorder
   - Press X button to remove exercise

3. **Test Add Exercise Button**:
   - Press "운동 추가" button
   - Exercise picker sheet should open

4. **Test Floating Action Button**:
   - Press the blue play button at bottom right
   - Should navigate to next incomplete exercise

## Expected Results

All buttons should:
- Respond immediately to touch
- Provide visual feedback when pressed
- Execute their functions correctly
- Work consistently across different devices

## If Issues Persist

Try:
1. Restart the Expo app
2. Clear Metro bundler cache: `expo start -c`
3. Check for any console errors
4. Verify no overlapping components blocking touches
