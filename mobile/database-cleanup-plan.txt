=== Database Cleanup Action Plan ===

IMMEDIATE FIXES NEEDED:
1. Remove duplicate GIF files (9 duplicates found)
2. Move 144 files from /all/ folder to proper categories  
3. Fix 60 exercises in wrong category folders
4. Create English filenames for 132 Korean GIFs
5. Merge shoulder/ and shoulders/ folders

MAIN ISSUES:
- 1,995 exercises but only 332 GIFs (many share same GIF)
- Mix of Korean and English filenames
- Files scattered in wrong folders
- Some exercises might have wrong GIFs

RECOMMENDED APPROACH:
1. First, consolidate and organize existing GIFs
2. Create proper English IDs for all files
3. Update database to match new structure
4. Re-upload to Supabase with clean names
5. Validate all exercises have correct GIFs

This will give you a clean, organized exercise database!
