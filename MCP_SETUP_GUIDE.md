# 🚀 MCP Setup for Korean Fitness App

## 📋 Configured MCP Servers

### ✅ Core Development Tools
1. **Filesystem** - Access all project files and directories
   - Path: `C:\Users\PW1234\.vscode\new finess app`
   - Use: File operations, reading code, project navigation

2. **Memory** - Persistent context across sessions
   - Use: Remember project details, user preferences, development history

3. **Sequential Thinking** - Complex problem solving
   - Use: Architecture decisions, debugging complex issues, feature planning

4. **Time** - Time operations and scheduling
   - Use: Development timelines, workout scheduling logic, analytics

### 🌐 External Integration Tools
5. **Fetch** - HTTP requests and API testing
   - Use: Test backend APIs, external service integration, data fetching

6. **GitHub** - Repository management
   - Use: Issue tracking, PR management, code review, repository analytics
   - **Token configured** for full functionality

### 🔍 Code Analysis Tools
7. **Grep** - Advanced code searching
   - Use: Find patterns across the codebase, debugging, refactoring

### 🧪 Testing & Automation Tools
8. **Puppeteer** - Browser automation (headless)
   - Use: E2E testing, automated testing, web scraping

9. **Playwright** - Cross-browser testing
   - Use: Comprehensive testing across browsers, mobile testing
   - **Note**: Run `npx playwright install` first time

## 🎯 Fitness App Specific Use Cases

### ⚙️ Backend Development  
- **Fetch**: Test Express.js API endpoints, database operations
- **Sequential Thinking**: Design database schema, optimize queries
- **Grep**: Find database models, API routes, middleware

### 🗄️ Database & Analytics
- **Time**: Handle workout timestamps, progress tracking, challenge dates
- **Memory**: Remember schema changes, migration history
- **Fetch**: Test analytics endpoints, data export features

### 📊 Social Features Development
- **GitHub**: Manage feature branches for social features
- **Puppeteer**: Test user interactions, following, challenges
- **Sequential Thinking**: Design notification systems, feed algorithms

### 🏆 Gamification & Tiers
- **Memory**: Track tier progression logic, point calculations
- **Time**: Handle challenge deadlines, streak tracking
- **Fetch**: Test tier advancement APIs, achievement systems

## 🔧 Quick Commands

### Test API Endpoints
```bash
# Use Fetch MCP to test your backend
# Example: Test user registration
# Example: Test workout logging
# Example: Test social features
```

### Code Analysis
```bash
# Use Grep MCP to find code patterns
# Find all API routes
# Find database models
# Find React components
```

### Automated Testing
```bash
# Use Puppeteer MCP for E2E testing
# Test workout flow
# Test social interactions
# Test tier progression
```

## 📝 Environment Setup

### Required for Full Functionality
- **Node.js**: For MCP servers
- **GitHub Token**: Already configured for repo access
- **Playwright**: Run `npx playwright install` for browser testing

### Optional Enhancements
Create `.env` file with:
```bash
# API Testing
API_BASE_URL=http://localhost:3000
TEST_USER_EMAIL=test@example.com

# Database
DATABASE_URL=your_database_connection

# External Services
SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_url
SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_supabase_key
```

## 🚦 Getting Started

1. **Restart Claude Code** to load new MCP configuration
2. **Test basic functionality**:
   - Ask me to list project files (Filesystem)
   - Ask me to search for specific code patterns (Grep)
   - Ask me to test an API endpoint (Fetch)

3. **Install Playwright** (if doing browser testing):
   ```bash
   npx playwright install
   ```

## 📊 Development Workflow Benefits
