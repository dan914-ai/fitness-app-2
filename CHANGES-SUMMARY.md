## 📝 Debugging Tips

### For "운동 시작" Issue
Check console logs for:
- `Starting workout with: {routineId, routineName}`
- `Routine data loaded:` - Check if exercises array is populated
- `Workout started, navigating to WorkoutSession`

If exercises array is empty, the routine might not have exercises loaded from mock data.

### For Stats Page
The page now handles offline mode gracefully:
- Shows "0분", "0kcal" instead of crashing
- Logs errors to console for debugging
- Falls back to null data when API fails

## 🚀 Next Steps

1. **Test the App**:
   ```bash
   cd mobile
   npx expo start
   ```

2. **Verify Fixes**:
   - Try "운동 시작" button with different routines
   - Navigate to 통계 tab - should not crash
   - Check 메뉴 tab for tier display

3. **Check Calculators**:
   - Menu → 1RM 계산기
   - Menu → 칼로리 계산기
   - Menu → 매크로 계산기

## 🎯 Summary
All requested changes have been implemented:
- ✅ 운동 시작 button debugging added
- ✅ 통계 page crash fixed
